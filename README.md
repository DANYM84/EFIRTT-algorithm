# Project Description:

The goal of this project is to develop a Python algorithm that uses the Tkinter library to create a user-friendly graphical interface and the OpenCV library for image processing. The algorithm will search for a user-selected folder and analyze all images within it, recognizing and translating written words into text. The translated text will then be analyzed for the frequency of each word in English, and the results will be stored for the user.

Algorithm Steps:

- Create a graphical interface using Tkinter that allows the user to select a folder to analyze.
- Use OpenCV to read all images in the selected folder.
- Apply optical character recognition (OCR) using OpenCV to convert the written text in the images to text format.
- Use a translation library to translate the converted text to English.
- Analyze the frequency of each word in the translated text using a natural language processing library.
- Display the frequency analysis results to the user in the graphical interface.
- Store the results in a file and provide an option for the user to export the data.
- This project aims to provide an efficient and user-friendly solution for analyzing written text in images and identifying the frequency of each word in English. It can be useful for tasks such as analyzing text in scanned documents or identifying keywords in marketing materials.
